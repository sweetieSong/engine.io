start localtunnel at 8000 port

run "node test.js id url (localtunnel)"
  test.js calls the correct module from /server/id since servers need to act differently
    each server id spawns a node server which defines different actions. (node. on receive message, throw error, send back message, etc)
    in test.js, spawn http server. and dynamically generate scripts and send them.

  finally spawn a third server to server these files. Only have these three servers regardless of how many server there are. Will perpetuate file server.
